This is my solution for HW5

## Problem 1

read in the data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest"~"unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"~"unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"~"solved"
    )
   ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") 
```

let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

can i do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
 broom::tidy() 
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

try to iterate…

``` r
result_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
   mutate(
     prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n =.y)),
     tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
   ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

make a plot

``` r
result_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

import one dataset

``` r
path_df =
  tibble(
  path = list.files("./data/data2")
) %>% 
  mutate(path = str_c("./data/data2/", path),
         observations = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))
         ) %>% 
  separate(path,c("subject_id","format"),sep = ".csv" ) %>% 
  separate(subject_id,c("format","subject_id"),sep = "2/" ) %>% 
  select(-format) %>% 
  separate(subject_id,c("arm","subject_id"),sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(
  arm = case_when(
      arm == "con"~"control",
      arm == "exp"~"experiment"
    )) %>% 
  unnest(observations) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to ="observations"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    week = str_replace(week,"week_",""),
    week = as.factor(week)) 
```

Comment: In these eight weeks, we can finds that in experimental groups,
the overall observational values are higher than the control groups. And
the trend of the experimental groups is increasing. As for the control
groups, the trend is approximately fluctuate without apparent increasing
or decreasing.

## Problem 3 (simulation - ttest - estimate - pvalue - plot/summarize of pvalue and estiamte by significant different or not)

Generate dataset

``` r
set.seed(1000)
df = rerun(5000, map(.x = 0, ~rnorm(n = 30, mean = (.x), sd = 5)))

nd_ttest = function(mu){
  norm_df = 
    tibble(x = rnorm(mean = mu, n =30, sd = 5)) 
  
  norm_df %>% summarize(
    t.test(x, mean = 0,conf.level = 0.95) %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>%
    select(estimate,p.value)
                       )
   
}

set.seed(1000)
sample_df = function(mu){
  rerun(5000,map(.x = mu, ~nd_ttest(.x))) %>% 
  bind_rows()
}

sample_df(0)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5,000 x 2
    ##    estimate p.value
    ##       <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1   -0.758   0.402

Repeat the above

``` r
set.seed(1000)
mu_df =

      ) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mu, ~sample_df(.x))
  )
```

Summarize

``` r

mureject_df = 
  mu_df %>% 
  unnest(output_lists) %>% 
  mutate(mu = as.numeric(mu)) %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  mutate(
    reject = case_when(
      p.value >= "0.05" ~1,
      p.value <= "0.05"~ 0
    )
  )  %>% 
  mutate(
    mu = as.factor(mu),
    reject = as.numeric(reject)) %>% 
  select(mu,reject) %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  summarize(
    test_total = n(),
    reject_total = sum(reject == "1" ),
    proportion = reject_total/test_total
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

plot - proportion of time the null was rejected

``` r

  ggplot(aes( x = mu , y = proportion), color = mu) +

  )
```

Describe the association between effect size and power.

plot - Average estimate of μ hat and true value of μ

``` r

  group_by(mu) %>% 
  summarize(
    average_estimate = mean(estimate)

plot - Average estimate of μ hat only in samples for which the null was

Is the sample average of μ̂ across tests for which the null is rejected
approximately equal to the true value of μ ? Why or why not?
